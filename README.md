# <div align="center">**Social Network API**</div>

## **Project Description**
> Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, you’ll need to use the Moment.js package to format time.
